      { q: "Tell me about yourself", a: "Hi, I’m Joshua Annor. I recently graduated in Computer Science from ODU. Over the past two years, I’ve had two internships — one at GE, where I worked on CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and Dynatrace, and another at Jacobs, where I used FactoryTalk and Python to automate SCADA-related data tasks. In school, most of my projects were in C++, and I also took a fully Linux-based course where everything was done through the terminal via SSH. Now I’m looking for an opportunity where I can put all those skills together and keep growing in DevOps." },
      { q: "What did you do with Jenkins at GE?", a: "I worked on CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, set up GitHub triggers, and integrated monitoring tools like Dynatrace. We also used Digital.ai Release to visualize the deployment process." },
      { q: "Experience with Linux?", a: "I took a fully Linux-based course at ODU and used Linux regularly at both GE and Jacobs. Tasks were completed and submitted via the terminal using SSH." },
      { q: "Experience with virtual machines?", a: "Yes, I used VMs to run Jenkins at GE and test SCADA tools at Jacobs. We often logged into VMs named after Spider-Man villains like Electro." },
      { q: "Do you know C++?", a: "Yes, most of my college projects were in C++. I built programs using object-oriented programming and file I/O." },
      { q: "Scripting languages used?", a: "I used Python and PowerShell for automation — Python for release tools and PowerShell for scripting tasks like auto-restarts based on alerts." },
      { q: "Worked with legacy systems?", a: "Yes, at Jacobs I helped modernize SCADA tag names from legacy formats to Rockwell naming standards using Excel and Power BI." },
      { q: "What interests you about this company?", a: "I like how it blends modern DevOps practices with mission-critical support for the Navy. It aligns with what I’ve worked on and what I want to grow in." },
      { q: "Handling CI/CD failures?", a: "I would check the logs, isolate the failure, fix it locally, test it again, and communicate with the team before re-running the pipeline." },
      { q: "Version control experience?", a: "Used Git and GitHub throughout school and at both internships. Familiar with branching, merging, pull requests, and GitHub Actions." },
      { q: "Project you’re proud of?", a: "My proudest project was a YAML parser script I wrote at GE. I made it generic enough to still be used two years later, and it's saved time and cost for the team." },
      { q: "Experience with YAML/config files?", a: "I wrote YAML templates for XL CLI automation and created configuration files for Jenkins pipelines." },
      { q: "Technical skill to improve?", a: "I want to go deeper into containerization and orchestration tools like Docker and Kubernetes." },
      { q: "What’s a technical script you wrote in PowerShell?", a: "I wrote a PowerShell script that generated a .txt file large enough to take up 95% of the C: drive space, then changed its date to two weeks prior. This triggered a Dynatrace alert, which started the disk cleanup process and cleared the Recycle Bin. It helped test and automate the response flow." }
